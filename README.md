Plus, we've got a vision simulator 👓 that lets you see the world through different eyes – literally!

And if you're ever stuck on finding the perfect color palette, don't sweat it. Our color palette finder 🎨 has got your back. Oh, and speaking of Instagram, be sure to check out our page @umc.photoart for some extra inspiration and behind-the-scenes fun. Let's create something awesome together!

## 🦄 Vision Simulator

Color blindness refers to a condition where individuals have difficulty distinguishing certain colors. There are different types of color blindness, including:

💚 Deuteranopia: Green-blindness, making it challenging to differentiate between red and green colors.

❤️ Protanopia: Red-blindness, causing difficulty in distinguishing between red and green colors.

💙 Tritanopia: Blue-blindness, leading to challenges in differentiating between blue and yellow colors.

🦋 **Animal Vision**: Animals perceive colors differently from humans due to variations in their visual systems. The app simulates the vision of three different animals:

🐶 Dog: Simulates blue-yellow colorblindness, similar to certain types of human color blindness.

🐱 Cat: Vision similar to grayscale, lacking the vibrant colors perceived by humans.

🦜 Bird: Enhanced UV perception, allowing birds to see a broader spectrum of colors, including ultraviolet light

## 📸 Mini Lightroom App

🎞 A mini Lightroom app is like having a pocket-sized photo studio in your hands! It lets you tweak and enhance your photos with powerful editing tools, from adjusting brightness and contrast to fine-tuning colors and adding artistic effects.

📕 **Saturation**: Controls the intensity or vividness of colors in an image.

📔 **Hue**: Represents the color's position on the color wheel, determining its shade or tint.

📘 **Temperature**: Adjusts the warmth or coolness of colors in an image, mimicking the effect of different lighting conditions.

📗 **Tint**: Adds a subtle color cast to an image, often used to create artistic effects or correct color balance.

📙 **Vibrance**: Enhances the intensity of muted colors without affecting skin tones, making them appear more vibrant and lively.

## 🌈 Color Palette Generator

🍭 Hey there! Ever heard of color theory? It's like the science behind the rainbow, helping us understand how colors work together to create different moods and effects. From the way they complement each other to the emotions they evoke, color theory is like a secret code that artists and designers use to make their creations pop!

🔴 **Primary Colors**: Red, blue, and yellow are considered primary colors because they cannot be created by mixing other colors. They are fundamental for creating all other colors in the color wheel.

🟠 **Secondary Colors**: Orange, green, and purple are secondary colors. They are created by mixing two primary colors together. For example, mixing red and blue creates purple.

🟡 **Complementary Colors**: Complementary colors are pairs of colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. When placed next to each other, they create contrast and make each other appear more vibrant.

🟢 **Analogous Colors**: Analogous colors are groups of colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel. They usually share similar hues and create a harmonious color scheme when used together.

🔵 **Triadic Colors**: Triadic colors are three colors that are evenly spaced around the color wheel. They provide a balanced and vibrant color scheme when used together, as they offer good contrast while maintaining harmony.



## About the App
# UMC Photoart App

The UMC Photoart App is a versatile tool for photo editing, color analysis, and color palette generation. It leverages various Python libraries and packages, including Streamlit, NumPy, PIL (Python Imaging Library), pandas, OpenCV (cv2), scikit-learn (for KMeans clustering), and Plotly.

## Features
- **Photo Editing**: The app includes a mini Lightroom feature that allows users to adjust image attributes such as brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, temperature, tint, and vibrance.
- **Vision Simulation**: Users can simulate different types of color vision deficiencies, such as deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia, as well as the vision of animals like dogs, cats, and birds.
- **Color Palette Generator**: The app provides a color palette generator that suggests complementary, analogous, and triadic color palettes based on user-selected colors from a dataset.

## Packages Used
- `streamlit`: For creating interactive web applications.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations and array operations.
- `PIL`: For image processing tasks such as opening, manipulating, and enhancing images.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis, particularly for handling the color dataset.
- `cv2`: OpenCV library for computer vision tasks, used for color blindness simulation.
- `sklearn.cluster.KMeans`: For clustering colors and generating color palettes.
- `plotly.graph_objects`: For interactive and dynamic data visualization.


## Future Plans
In the future I hope to take this app further by implementing other techniques. Some concepts that I was thinking about include remove background, color trend analysis and historic uses of color. Hoping to work on this is in the summer :)
